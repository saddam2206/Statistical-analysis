# 📊 Data Analysis & Statistical Testing Project

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive **data analysis and statistical evaluation notebook** designed to explore relationships within a structured dataset and assess business or operational hypotheses using statistical methods.

The project demonstrates practical implementation of **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **hypothesis testing**, and **statistical inference**, making it suitable for academic assignments, research practice, and entry-level data science portfolios.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Perform structured **data exploration and cleaning**
* Analyze relationships between key variables
* Apply **statistical hypothesis testing** techniques
* Interpret results with real-world context
* Present findings in a clear, reproducible notebook format

---

## 🧪 Methods & Techniques Used

The notebook includes implementation of:

* **Descriptive Statistics**

  * Mean, variance, standard deviation
  * Distribution analysis

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

  * Data summaries
  * Visualization for insights

* **Hypothesis Testing**

  * One-sample t-test
  * Paired t-test
